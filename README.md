## Get Some Adventure
(GetSomeAdventure.ps1) uses the **Create a Space Adventure** table to generate a simple plot statement, such as:

* A Rogue Captain wants to synthesize an alien artifact, which will start a invasion!
* Cyber Zombies want to pacify the Star Dreadnought, which will enslave a planet!
* Space Pirates want to corrupt an alien artifact which will fix everything!
* Alien brain worms want to protect an ancient space ruin which will enslave a planet!

Sure, they don't all make sense, but that is the nature of the table.
